## Additional troubleshooting:
 - Did you type the name of the file correctly? You can check by running 'ls introduction.js'. If you see 'ls: cannot access introduction.js: No such file or directory,' then perhaps the file doesn't exist, or has a different name, or is in a different directory.
 - Make sure you didn't omit any parens, or the compiler will not be able to parse it.       
 - Make sure you don't have any typos in the string itself.
