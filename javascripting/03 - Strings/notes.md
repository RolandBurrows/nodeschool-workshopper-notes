 ## STRINGS (Exercise 3 of 19)

  A string is a sequence of characters. A character is, roughly speaking, a
  written symbol. Examples of characters are letters, numbers, punctuation
  marks, and spaces.

  String values are surrounded by either single or double quotation marks.

     'this is a string'

     "this is also a string"

 ### NOTE

  Try to stay consistent. In this workshop we'll only use single quotation
  marks.
